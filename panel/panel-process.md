#### Introduction

Paneling involves assigning patients to specific primary care providers to ensure consistent care and reliable data. The following implements the 4-cut method to assign patients to their providers.

#### 4-Cut Method

The systematic **4-Cut Method** is used for  Palouse Medical, Pullman Family Medicine, and Residency clinics based on their visit history over the last 2 years:

1. **1st Cut**: Patients who have seen only one provider are assigned to that provider.
2. **2nd Cut**: Patients who have seen multiple providers but one provider the majority of the time are assigned to the majority provider.
3. **3rd Cut**: Patients who have seen two or more providers equally are assigned to the provider who performed the last physical exam.
4. **4th Cut**: Remaining patients are assigned to the last provider seen.

For more details on the 4-Cut Method, refer to the following resources: [AAFP article from 2007](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/fpm/issues/2007/0400/p44.html), [NACHC guide](https://www.nachc.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Empanelment_Pop-Health-Mgmt_Action-Guide-April-2022.pdf).

#### Other Paneling Criteria

Clinics can aso use other criteria to determine their panels. Palouse Pediatrics uses the following to determine patient paneling to the practice, rather than to a specific provider:

1. **Patients with at least 3 visits in the last 2 years**, and the last 3 visits were at Pediatrics.
2. **Patients whose last well visit was in the last 2 years** with Pediatrics, and at least one of the last 3 visits was at Pediatrics.
3. **Patients with no well visit in the last 2 years**, but has had at least 3 visits in the last year. The majority were with Pediatrics, and at least one of the last 3 visits was at Pediatrics.
4. **Exclude patients under 3 years old with no Pediatrics visits for 15 months**.

Currently, Palouse Pediatrics does not empanel patients to a specific provider.
