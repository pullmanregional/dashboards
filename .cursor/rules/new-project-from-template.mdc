# Project Template Copy and Setup

## Introduction

This rule defines the process for creating new Streamlit projects by copying from the template directory. The process involves two main steps: copying the template structure and updating references to match the new project name.

## Process Steps

1. **Initial Copy**
   - Use `cp -r` to copy the entire template directory structure
   - This preserves all file relationships and structure
   - Example: `cp -r template/ new-project-name/`

2. **Reference Updates**
   - Update all references from "template" or "sample" to the new project name
   - Maintain case sensitivity (e.g., "TEMPLATE" â†’ "NEW_PROJECT")
   - Required files to update (at minimum):
     - `.vscode/launch.json` - Update launch configurations
     - `<new project>/.streamlit/config.toml`
     - `<new project>/.streamlit/secrets.toml`
     - `<new project>/prefect/.env.dev`
     - `<new project>/prefect/.env.prod`
     - `<new project>/prefect/flow.py`
     - `<new project>/src/source_data.py`
     - `<new project>/app.py`
     - `<new project>/config.prod.toml`
   - Never modify:
     - `.python-version`
   - Also update in:
     - Import statements
     - Configuration files
     - Documentation references
     - Code
   - Don't ever update the theme section in streamlit configuration files.
   - Don't add sections to the streamlit configuration files, just update references from template to the new project name

3. **VS Code Launch Configurations**
   - Add the following configurations to `.vscode/launch.json`, but update `<project>` to match the new project:
     ```json
    {
      "name": "Ingest: <project name>",
      "type": "debugpy",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/<project>/prefect/ingest_datamart.py",
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/<project>/prefect",
      "args": [
        "--prw",
        "sqlite:///../../../prh-warehouse/prw.sqlite3",
        "--out",
        "prh-<project>.sqlite3",
        "--kv",
        "prh-<project>.json"
      ],
      "console": "integratedTerminal",
      "justMyCode": true
    },
    {
      "name": "Streamlit: <project>",
      "type": "debugpy",
      "request": "launch",
      "module": "streamlit",
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/<project>",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "app.py"
      ],
      "console": "integratedTerminal",
      "justMyCode": false
    },
     ```
   - `.vscode/launch.json` will already exists, so update it, don't write a new one.
   - Add the above configurations in their corresponding section. There will already be some ingest and some streamlit configurations. Insert them appropriately.

## Implementation Guidelines

- Always perform the copy and update in two distinct steps
- Show the diff between template and new project to verify changes
- Maintain existing code structure and only update references
- Ensure all file paths and imports are updated correctly
- Double check all required files have been updated before proceeding

## Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting to update case-sensitive references
- Missing hidden files or directories during copy
- Not updating all import paths
- Not copying first, saving, then making changes
- Modifying `.python-version` file (this should never be changed)
- Missing any of the required files in the update list
